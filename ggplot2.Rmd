```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Learning ggplot2 

This is an R Markdown document that we created to use **ggplot2**. 

1. **I have no clue how to use ggplot2**
2. **Hopefully I will learn after lunch**

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
